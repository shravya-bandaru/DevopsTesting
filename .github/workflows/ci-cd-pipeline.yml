# CI/CD Pipeline workflow for automated testing and deployment to Azure App Service
# This pipeline implements the PwC DevOps diagram with multi-stage builds and progressive deployment strategies
name: CI/CD Pipeline - Azure App Service with Blue-Green & Canary Deployments

# When this workflow triggers:
# - Pull requests to main/develop branches → Run fast tests (DEV + QA)
# - Pushes to main → Full pipeline (build, test, deploy to staging, canary, then production)
# - Pushes to testbranch → Build and test stages only
# - Manual trigger → Allows on-demand workflow execution
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, testbranch ]
  push:
    branches: [ main, testbranch ]
